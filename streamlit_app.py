    Face detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision that focuses on locating and identifying human faces within digital images or video streams. It serves as a critical preprocessing step for many real-world applications such as face recognition, surveillance systems, human–computer interaction, and biometric authentication. Traditional face detection methods relied on handcrafted features and rule-based classifiers; however, these approaches often struggle with variations in lighting, pose, scale, and background complexity.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
    With the advancement of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the dominant approach for face detection tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from raw image data. In this project, a face detection model based on the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture is implemented. VGG16 is a deep CNN composed of 16 trainable layers and is well known for its use of small 3×3 convolutional filters stacked in depth, which enables effective extraction of high-level visual features. By leveraging a VGG16 network pretrained on the ImageNet dataset, the model benefits from transfer learning, allowing it to achieve improved accuracy and faster convergence even with limited training data. The extracted features are then utilized to detect facial regions accurately, making the proposed system robust to variations in facial appearance and environmental conditions.
